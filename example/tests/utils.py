    The response.content is already a JSON formatted string BUT
    we don't know anything about its formatting, in particular,
    the indent and separators arguments. DRF has a complex method to
    determine what values to use for each argument and unfortunately,
    the methods aren't the same in all DRF versions.

    So what to do? LOAD the JSON formmated string (response.content)
    as a Python object and DUMP it again and hence the name of this function.

    This will guarantee that we're comparing two similarly formatted JSON
    strings. Only the formatting similarity is guaranteed. As for the content,
    that's what the tests are for!
