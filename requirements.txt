# The base set of requirements for Django REST framework JSON:API is actually
# fairly small, but for the purposes of development and testing
# there are a number of packages that are useful to install.

# Laying these out as separate requirements files, allows us to
# only include the relevant sets when running tox, and ensures
# we are only ever declaring our dependencies in one place.
