# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Note that in line with [Django REST Framework policy](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/topics/release-notes/),
any parts of the framework not mentioned in the documentation should generally be considered private API, and may be subject to change.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

* Ability for the user to select `included_serializers` to apply when using `BrowsableAPI`, based on available `included_serializers` defined for the current endpoint.

### Fixed

* Allow users to overwrite a view's `get_serializer_class()` method when using [related urls](https://django-rest-framework-json-api.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage.html#related-urls)
* Correctly resolve the resource type of `ResourceRelatedField(many=True)` fields on plain serializers


## [4.0.0] - 2020-10-31

This release is not backwards compatible. For easy migration best upgrade first to version
3.2.0 and resolve all deprecation warnings before updating to 4.0.0

### Added

* Added support for Django REST framework 3.12.
* Added support for Django 3.1.
* Added support for Python 3.9.
* Added initial optional support for [openapi](https://www.openapis.org/) schema generation. Enable with:
  ```
  pip install djangorestframework-jsonapi['openapi']
  ```
  This first release is a start at implementing OAS schema generation. To use the generated schema you may
  still need to manually add some schema attributes but can expect future improvements here and as
  upstream DRF's OAS schema generation continues to mature.

### Removed


* Removed support for Python 3.5.
* Removed support for Django 1.11.
* Removed support for Django 2.1.
* Removed support for Django REST framework 3.10 and 3.11.
* Removed obsolete `source` argument of `SerializerMethodResourceRelatedField`.
* Removed obsolete setting `JSON_API_SERIALIZE_NESTED_SERIALIZERS_AS_ATTRIBUTE` to render nested serializers as relationships.
  Default is render as attribute now.

### Fixed

* Stopped `SparseFieldsetsMixin` interpretting invalid fields query parameter (e.g. invalidfields[entries]=blog,headline).

## [3.2.0] - 2020-08-26

This is the last release supporting Django 1.11, Django 2.1, Django REST Framework 3.10, Django REST Framework 3.11 and Python 3.5.

### Added

* Added support for serializing nested serializers as attribute json value introducing setting `JSON_API_SERIALIZE_NESTED_SERIALIZERS_AS_ATTRIBUTE`
 * Note: As keys of nested serializers are not json:api spec field names they are not inflected by format field names option.
* Added `rest_framework_json_api.serializer.Serializer` class to support initial JSON API views without models.
  * Note that serializers derived from this class need to define `resource_name` in their `Meta` class.
  * This fix might be a **BREAKING CHANGE** if you use `rest_framework_json_api.serializers.Serializer` for non json:api spec views (usually `APIView`). You need to change those serializers classes to use `rest_framework.serializers.Serializer` instead.

### Fixed

* Avoid `AttributeError` for PUT and PATCH methods when using `APIView`
* Clear many-to-many relationships instead of deleting related objects during PATCH on `RelationshipView`
* Allow POST, PATCH, DELETE for actions in `ReadOnlyModelViewSet`. Regression since version `2.8.0`.
* Properly format nested errors

### Changed

* `SerializerMethodResourceRelatedField` is now consistent with DRF `SerializerMethodField`:
   * Pass `method_name` argument to specify method name. If no value is provided, it defaults to `get_{field_name}`
* Allowed repeated filter query parameters.

### Deprecated

* Deprecate `source` argument of `SerializerMethodResourceRelatedField`, use `method_name` instead
* Rendering nested serializers as relationships is deprecated. Use `ResourceRelatedField` instead


## [3.1.0] - 2020-02-08

### Added

* Added support for Python 3.8
* Added support for Django REST framework 3.11
* Added support for Django 3.0

### Fixed

* Properly return parser error when primary data is of invalid type
* Pass instance to child serializers when using `PolymorphicModelSerializer`
* Properly resolve related resource type when using `PolymorphicModelSerializer`

## [3.0.0] - 2019-10-14

This release is not backwards compatible. For easy migration best upgrade first to version
2.8.0 and resolve all deprecation warnings before updating to 3.0.0

### Added

* Added support for Django REST framework 3.10.
* Added code from `ErrorDetail` into the JSON:API error object.

### Changed

  pip install djangorestframework-jsonapi['django-filter']
  ```

### Removed

## [2.8.0] - 2019-06-13

This is the last release supporting Python 2.7, Python 3.4, Django Filter 1.1, Django REST Framework <=3.9 and Django 2.0.

### Added

* Add support for Django 2.2

### Changed

* Allow to define `select_related` per include using [select_for_includes](https://django-rest-framework-json-api.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage.html#performance-improvements)
* Use REST framework serializer functionality to extract includes. This adds support like using
  dotted notations in source attribute in `ResourceRelatedField`.

### Fixed

* Don't swallow `filter[]` params when there are several
* Fix DeprecationWarning regarding collections.abc import in Python 3.7

  - Django >= 2.1 is not supported with Python < 3.5.

### Fixed

* Pass context from `PolymorphicModelSerializer` to child serializers to support fields which require a `request` context such as `url`.
* Avoid patch on `RelationshipView` deleting relationship instance when constraint would allow null ([#242](https://github.com/django-json-api/django-rest-framework-json-api/issues/242))
* Avoid error with related urls when retrieving relationship which is referenced as `ForeignKey` on parent
* Do not render `write_only` relations
* Do not skip empty one-to-one relationships
* Allow `HyperlinkRelatedField` to be used with [related urls](https://django-rest-framework-json-api.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage.html?highlight=related%20links#related-urls)
* Avoid exception in `AutoPrefetchMixin` when including a reverse one to one relation ([#537](https://github.com/django-json-api/django-rest-framework-json-api/issues/537))
* Avoid requested resource(s) to be added to included as well ([#524](https://github.com/django-json-api/django-rest-framework-json-api/issues/524))

## [2.6.0] - 2018-09-20

### Added

* Add testing configuration to `REST_FRAMEWORK` configuration as described in [DRF](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/testing/#configuration)
* Add `HyperlinkedRelatedField` and `SerializerMethodHyperlinkedRelatedField`. See [usage docs](docs/usage.md#related-fields)
* Add related urls support. See [usage docs](docs/usage.md#related-urls)
* Add optional [jsonapi-style](http://jsonapi.org/format/) filter backends. See [usage docs](docs/usage.md#filter-backends)

### Deprecated

* Deprecate `MultipleIDMixin` because it doesn't comply with the JSON:API 1.0 spec. Replace it with
  `DjangoFilterBackend` and **change clients** to use `filter[id.in]` query parameter instead of `ids[]`.
  See [usage docs](docs/usage.md#djangofilterbackend). You also have the option to copy the mixin into your code.

### Changed

* Replaced binary `drf_example` sqlite3 db with a [fixture](example/fixtures/drf_example.json). See [getting started](docs/getting-started.md#running-the-example-app).
* Replaced unmaintained [API doc](docs/api.md) with [auto-generated API reference](docs/api.rst).

### Fixed

* Performance improvement when rendering relationships with `ModelSerializer`
* Do not show deprecation warning when user has implemented custom pagination class overwriting default values.


## [2.5.0] - 2018-07-11

### Added

* Add new pagination classes based on JSON:API query parameter *recommendations*:
  * `JsonApiPageNumberPagination` and `JsonApiLimitOffsetPagination`. See [usage docs](docs/usage.md#pagination).
* Add `ReadOnlyModelViewSet` extension with prefetch mixins
* Add support for Django REST Framework 3.8.x
* Introduce `JSON_API_FORMAT_FIELD_NAMES` option replacing `JSON_API_FORMAT_KEYS` but in comparison preserving
  values from being formatted as attributes can contain any [json value](http://jsonapi.org/format/#document-resource-object-attributes).
* Allow overwriting of `get_queryset()` in custom `ResourceRelatedField`

### Deprecated

* Deprecate `PageNumberPagination` and `LimitOffsetPagination`. Use `JsonApiPageNumberPagination` and `JsonApiLimitOffsetPagination` instead.
  * To retain deprecated values for `PageNumberPagination` and `LimitOffsetPagination` create new custom class like the following in your code base:
  ```python
  class CustomPageNumberPagination(PageNumberPagination):
    page_query_param = "page"
    page_size_query_param = "page_size"

  class CustomLimitOffsetPagination(LimitOffsetPagination):
    max_limit = None
  ```
  and adjust `REST_FRAMEWORK['DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS']` setting accordingly.
* Deprecate `JSON_API_FORMAT_KEYS`, use `JSON_API_FORMAT_FIELD_NAMES`.
