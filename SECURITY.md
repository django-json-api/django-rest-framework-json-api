# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you've found something in Django REST framework JSON:API which has security implications, please **do not raise the issue in a public forum**.

Use the security advisory to [report a vulnerability](https://github.com/django-json-api/django-rest-framework-json-api/security/advisories/new) instead.

The project maintainers will then work with you to resolve any issues where required, prior to any public disclosure.
